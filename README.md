## Contributing

There was much help to build a working product. 
    Credit goes to:
        1. Kelly Gowing - She helped with initial layout and javascript.
       
        2. Makai Post - Who had a terrific page with a great answer correct/wrong box (I just had to have it)
                        Also had nice randomizing of the questions and answers which took me too many hours to recreate.
                        I have to admit this project is based on what Makai had for arrays, random, time convert and correct box.
       
        3. Inez Escandon - who helped with some ideas on approach for question, next question hide/unhide.
       
        4. Web Dev Simplified - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k This video was awesome for helping get this going.
        
        5. Hours of Google searching and preparing to pull all my hair out.
